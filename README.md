# PHP-What-I-Learned
This repository consists of PHP codes that I learned at school.

# About this repository and me
I have been interested in PHP for an average of two years, but this semester (about 4 months) with my school, I took a regular look at PHP language for the first time. This gave me the opportunity to consolidate my scattered knowledge of PHP.

The reason I started sharing what I learned about PHP here was that I needed to start using GitHub from somewhere.

However, I still couldn't share everything I learned about PHP here. I didn't have time for this as I was delaying using GitHub. That's why I've tried to share only the things that I find important here. This had a significant impact on my success in exams.  Apart from that, I can say that it helped me to advance my applied project assignment.

In general, I can summarize what we learned in PHP lessons as follows;
We learned PHP language-specific code blocks and functions that will help us think algorithmically, especially in our projects. And also MySql and phpMyAdmin are among the things we learned before.

# Some notes
- I took my lessons in Turkish. However, I thought it would be appropriate to write my articles in English in order to appeal to everyone.
- I will share my applied project assignment here soon.
